To be protected under the Freshwater Wetlands Act, a wetland must be 12.4 acres (5 hectares or larger). Wetlands smaller than this may be protected if they are considered of unusual local importance. Around every wetland is an 'adjacent area' of 100 feet that is also regulated to provide protection for the wetland. A permit is required to conduct any regulated activity in a protected wetland or its adjacent area. Wetlands shown on the DEC maps usually are also regulated by the Corps, but the Corps also regulates additional wetlands not shown on the DEC maps. Different wetlands provide different functions and benefits and in varying degrees. The Act requires DEC to rank wetlands in classes based on the benefits and values provided by each wetland. The wetland class helps to determine the best uses for each wetland. Higher class wetlands provide the greatest level of benefits and are afforded a higher level of protection. Lower class wetlands still provide important functions and benefits, but typically require less protection to continue to provide these functions.Digital wetlands data are not official regulatory maps and are subject to change.",
